# Mental Models: A Comprehensive List

## General Thinking Tools

1. **The Map is Not the Territory**
   The map is not the territory reminds us that our mental models of the world are not the same as the world itself. It cautions against confusing our abstractions and representations with the complex, ever-­shifting reality they aim to describe.

2. **Circle of Competence**
   Your circle of competence is your personal sphere of expertise, where your knowledge and skills are concentrated. It's the domain where you have a deep understanding, where your judgments are reliable, and your decisions are sound.

3. **First Principles Thinking**
   First principles thinking is the art of breaking down complex problems into their fundamental truths. It's a way of thinking that goes beyond the surface and allows us to see things from a new perspective.

4. **Thought Experiment**
   Thought experiments are the sandbox of the mind, the place where we can play with ideas without constraints. They're a way of exploring the implications of our theories, of testing the boundaries of our understanding.

5. **Second-Order Thinking**
   Second-­order thinking is a method of thinking that goes beyond the surface level, beyond the knee-­jerk reactions and short-­term gains. It asks us to play the long game, to anticipate the ripple effects of our actions.

6. **Probabilistic Thinking**
   Probabilistic thinking is the art of navigating uncertainty. Successfully thinking in shades of probability means roughly identifying what matters, calculating the odds, checking our assumptions, and then deciding.

7. **Inversion**
   Inversion is not the way we are taught to think. We are taught to identify what we want and explore things that will move us closer to our objective. However, avoiding things that ensure we don't get what we want dramatically increases our odds of success.

8. **Occam's Razor**
   When faced with competing explanations or solutions, Occam's razor suggests that the correct explanation is most likely the simplest one, the one that makes the fewest assumptions.

9. **Hanlon's Razor**
   Hanlon's razor is a mental safeguard against the temptation to label behavior as malicious when incompetence is the most common response. It's a reminder that people are not out to get you, and it's best to assume good faith and resist the urge to assign sinister motives without overwhelming evidence.

## Physics, Chemistry, and Biology

10. **Relativity**
    Relativity is the idea that our perceptions and judgments are not absolute but are shaped by our unique vantage points and frames of reference. It's the understanding that our experiences are subjective.

11. **Reciprocity**
    Reciprocity underlies everything from basic human kindness to the most complex systems of trade. At its core, reciprocity is the simple idea of treating others as they treat us—giving what we get.

12. **Thermodynamics**
    Thermodynamics is the science of energy, heat, and work. It's the set of physical laws that govern how energy moves and changes in the universe.

13. **Inertia**
    Inertia is the stubborn resistance of the universe to change. It's why objects at rest tend to stay at rest, and objects in motion tend to stay in motion.

14. **Friction and Viscosity**
    Friction and viscosity are the sand in the gears of the universe, the invisible hands that slow the motion of all things.

15. **Velocity**
    Velocity is the great differentiator, distinguishing the stagnant from the swift. It's not just about raw speed; direction matters just as much (if not more).

16. **Leverage**
    Leverage is the force multiplier of the world, the principle that allows the small to move the large and the few to influence the many.

17. **Activation Energy**
    Activation energy is the spark that ignites the fire of change, the initial burst of effort required to kick-­start a reaction or transformation.

18. **Catalysts**
    Catalysts are the unsung heroes of chemical reactions, the silent partners accelerating change. By decreasing the time required to cause change, they also make reactions possible that might not have occurred otherwise.

19. **Alloying**
    Alloying is the art of mixing elements to create something greater than the sum of its parts. While our intuition tells us that pure substances are best, alloying shows this is not always true.

20. **Evolution: Natural Selection and Extinction**
    Natural selection is the hidden hand that selects the fittest from a never-­ending pile of genetic variation, while extinction is the hammer that shatters the unfit and clears the way for variations to arise.

21. **Evolution: Adaptation and The Red Queen Effect**
    The Red Queen effect results from the never-­ending arms race between predator and prey, parasite and host, and competitor and competitor. As one species evolves a new adaptation, others evolve countermeasures, leading to a constant escalation.

22. **Ecosystems**
    Nothing exists in isolation. Everything is connected. The ecosystem lens reveals that each species plays its part in a delicate balance of competition and cooperation.

23. **Niches**
    A niche is a special place where a particular species or idea can thrive. It's the ecological equivalent of a custom-­fitted suit tailored to its occupant's unique needs and abilities.

24. **Self-Preservation**
    Self-­preservation is a core instinct that drives all living things to protect and sustain their own existence.

25. **Replication**
    Replication is the molecular magic trick that allows organisms to make copies of themselves to pass their genetic blueprints from one generation to the next.

26. **Cooperation**
    Cooperation is the surprising secret of success in the ruthless world of survival. If there is any one model that explains humanity, then this is it.

27. **Hierarchical Organization**
    Hierarchy is the invisible scaffolding that organizes the living world.

## Systems

28. **Feedback Loops**
    Feedback loops are the engines of growth and change. They're the mechanisms by which the output of a system influences its own input.

29. **Equilibrium**
    Equilibrium is the state of balance, where opposing forces cancel each other out. It's the calm in the storm's center, the stable point around which the chaos swirls.

30. **Bottlenecks**
    Bottlenecks are the choke points, the narrow parts of the hourglass where everything slows down. They're the constraints that limit the flow, the weakest links in the chain that determine the strength of the whole.

31. **Scale**
    Systems change as they scale up or down; neither is intrinsically better or worse. The right scale depends on your goals and the context.

32. **Margin of Safety**
    Margin of safety is a secret weapon. It's the buffer, the extra capacity, the redundancy that you build into a system to handle unexpected stress.

33. **Churn**
    Churn is the silent killer of businesses. It's the slow leak, the constant drip of customers slipping away, of users drifting off to find something new.

34. **Algorithms**
    Algorithms are recipes. A list of crisp, unambiguous steps that tell you how to get from point A to point B.

35. **Critical Mass**
    Critical mass isn't just a science term; it's a guide for understanding that often things happen slowly and then all at once.

36. **Emergence**
    Nearly everything is an emergent ­effect—​­a table, a space shuttle, even ­ us—​­ combinations of ingredients that come together in a specific way to create something new.

37. **Irreducibility**
    Irreducibility is about essence. It's the idea that some things can't be broken down into smaller parts without losing what makes them tick.

38. **Law of Diminishing Returns**
    Diminishing returns is the idea that the easy wins usually come first. The more you optimize a system, the harder it gets to eke out additional improvements.

## Numeracy

39. **Sampling**
    Sample size is about how much of the world you're looking at. It's the number of data points you're using to draw conclusions.

40. **Randomness**
    Randomness is the chaos that underlies the cosmos. It's the unpredictable, the uncontrollable, the stuff that doesn't follow any discernible pattern.

41. **Regression To The Mean**
    Regression to the mean is the universe's way of saying "not so fast." It's the tendency for extreme outcomes to be followed by more average ones.

42. **Multiply by Zero**
    Multiplying by zero is the mathematical version of the Midas touch in reverse. Everything it touches turns to nothing.

43. **Equivalence**
    Equivalence is the art of making things interchangeable. It's the idea that two things can be swapped out without changing the essence of what they're a part of.

44. **Surface Area**
    Surface area is what determines how much an object interacts with its environment. The more surface area, the more contact.

45. **Global and Local Maxima**
    Global and local maxima as a model can be used differently to help us make the changes we need for success. It encourages us to see achieving our goals not as a steady upward trajectory but as a path full of peaks and valleys.

## Microeconomics

46. **Scarcity**
    Scarcity shapes our choices and drives our actions. When something is scarce, it suddenly becomes valuable.

47. **Supply and Demand**
    Supply and demand are the push and pull determining availability and price. Their dance is never-ending.

48. **Optimization**
    Optimization is about making the most of what you have. It's like cleverly solving a puzzle, finding a trick to skip steps and get to the answer faster.

49. **Trade-offs**
    Life is full of trade-offs. Every choice has a cost. When you say yes to one thing, you say no to others.

50. **Specialization**
    Specialization is a ­trade-​­off: pursuing one course means not pursuing another. It's narrowing your focus to broaden your impact.

51. **Interdependence**
    Interdependence is the web that ties us all together. It's the recognition that no person, company, or country is an island.

52. **Efficiency**
    Efficiency is about getting the most done with the least waste. It's not always about finding the perfect answer but the one that works well enough without too much fuss.

53. **Debt**
    Debt is a double-edged sword. It's a powerful tool to help you grow a business, buy a home, or seize an opportunity. But it's also a chain that can bind your future or destroy you.

54. **Monopoly and Competition**
    Monopoly and competition are the yin and yang of the business world. They're the opposing forces that shape the landscape of every market, the tides that lift and sink the fortunes of every firm.

55. **Creative Destruction**
    Creative destruction is the engine of progress in a capitalist economy. It's the process by which new innovations replace old ones, the cycle of birth and death that keeps an economy vibrant.

56. **Gresham's Law**
    Gresham's Law states that bad money drives out good. But it's not just about currency. The principle applies anytime there are two competing versions of something, one perceived as high quality and the other as low quality.

57. **Bubbles**
    Bubbles are a natural by-product of human nature. They happen when collective enthusiasm for an asset runs far ahead of its fundamental value.

## Art

58. **Audience**
    The audience is the invisible participant in every work of art. They are the eyes that see, the ears that hear, the minds that interpret.

59. **Genre**
    Genre is more than just a label; it's a set of conventions, an understanding between the artist and the audience.

60. **Contrast**
    Contrast is the spice of life and art. It's the clash of opposites that energizes a work and jolts our senses.

61. **Framing**
    Framing is the art of context, the craft of shaping perception. It's how we present information, the lens through which we invite others to view the world.

62. **Rhythm**
    Rhythm is the universe's heartbeat, the pulse animating life. From our steady heartbeats to the sun's rise and fall, from crashing waves to swaying trees, rhythm is the pattern underlying existence.

63. **Melody**
    Melody is music's soul, the ethereal thread weaving through sound's tapestry. It's the part of a song that we hum in the shower, the tune that gets stuck in our head and won't let go.

64. **Representation**
    Representation is the mental shorthand we use to navigate the complexities of reality, the symbols and images we use to communicate our thoughts and experiences.

65. **Plot**
    The plot is the story's engine, propelling characters and events through time. It's the sequence of causally connected events that leads from the beginning of a narrative to its resolution.

66. **Character**
    At their core, characters are bundles of traits and motivations, of habits and histories, of strengths and flaws. They are the total of their choices and actions, the product of genetics, choices, and circumstances.

67. **Setting**
    The setting is the stage upon which the drama of the story unfolds, the physical and temporal context that shapes and reflects the actions of characters.

68. **Performance**
    Performance is the art of the ephemeral, the fleeting moment of creative expression existing only in the here and now.

## Military and War

69. **Seeing the Front**
    The importance of firsthand information in decision-making.

70. **Asymmetric Warfare**
    When one side uses different tactics due to resource limitations.

71. **Two-Front War**
    The challenges and strategies of fighting on multiple fronts.

72. **Counterinsurgency**
    Strategies developed to combat asymmetric warfare.

73. **Mutually Assured Destruction**
    The paradox where increased strength can lead to decreased likelihood of conflict.

## Human Nature and Judgment

74. **Trust**
    Fundamentally, the modern world operates on trust. A trusting system is one that tends to work most efficiently; the rewards of trust are extremely high.

75. **Bias from Incentives**
    Humans are highly responsive to incentives, which causes us to distort our thinking when it is in our own interest to do so.

76. **Pavlovian Association**
    Human beings can respond not just to direct incentives but also to associated objects, with emotions coming from past associations rather than direct effects.

77. **Tendency to Feel Envy & Jealousy**
    Humans have a tendency to feel envious of those receiving more than they are, and a desire "get what is theirs" in due course.

78. **Tendency to Distort Due to Liking/Loving or Disliking/Hating**
    Humans have a tendency to distort their thinking in favor of people or things that they like and against people or things they dislike.

79. **Denial**
    Denying reality can be a coping mechanism, a survival mechanism, or a purposeful tactic.

80. **Availability Heuristic**
    We tend to most easily recall what is salient, important, frequent, and recent.

81. **Representativeness Heuristic**
    This includes the failure to account for base rates, tendency to stereotype, and failure to see false conjunctions.

82. **Social Proof (Safety in Numbers)**
    We have a DNA-level instinct to seek safety in numbers and will look for social guidance of our behavior.

83. **Narrative Instinct**
    Human beings have been appropriately called "the storytelling animal" because of our instinct to construct and seek meaning in narrative.

84. **Curiosity Instinct**
    We are the most curious of all species, an instinct which led us out of the savanna and led us to learn a great deal about the world around us.

85. **Language Instinct**
    We have a DNA-level instinct to learn grammatically constructed language.

86. **First-Conclusion Bias**
    The mind works a bit like a sperm and egg: the first idea gets in and then the mind shuts.

87. **Tendency to Overgeneralize from Small Samples**
    We take a small number of instances and create a general category, even if we have no statistically sound basis for the conclusion.

88. **Relative Satisfaction/Misery Tendencies**
    Our happiness is often related to our state relative to either our past or our peers, not absolute conditions.

89. **Commitment & Consistency Bias**
    Humans are subject to a bias towards keeping their prior commitments and staying consistent with our prior selves when possible.

90. **Hindsight Bias**
    Once we know the outcome, it's nearly impossible to turn back the clock mentally. We tend to reason that we knew it all along.

91. **Sensitivity to Fairness**
    We are careful arbiters of what is fair. Violations of fairness can be considered grounds for reciprocal action, or at least distrust.

92. **Tendency to Overestimate Consistency of Behavior (Fundamental Attribution Error)**
    We tend to over-ascribe the behavior of others to their innate traits rather than to situational factors, leading us to overestimate how consistent that behavior will be in the future.

93. **Influence of Stress (Including Breaking Points)**
    Stress causes both mental and physiological responses and tends to amplify other biases.

94. **Survivorship Bias**
    We over-attribute success to things done by the successful agent rather than to randomness or luck, and we often learn false lessons by exclusively studying victors without seeing all of the accompanying losers.

95. **Tendency to Want to Do Something**
    Most humans have the tendency to need to act, even when their actions are not needed. We also tend to offer solutions even when we do not have knowledge to solve the problem.

96. **Falsification / Confirmation Bias**
    We tend to look for confirmations of long-held wisdom rather than violations. What we believe is what we choose to see.

These mental models provide a framework for understanding human behavior, decision-making processes, and complex systems across various domains. By mastering these models, we can improve our critical thinking and problem-solving skills, leading to better decisions in both personal and professional contexts.
